The popular game Tic-tac-toe designed while a College Fresher

## Welcome to Tic-tac-toe
This is the popular game we usually play since childhood. The easiest and our favourite game of our past-times now digitized to have more fun amidst our other monotonous tasks of daily life.

## Implementation
We have tried to design this game in JavaScript and Java having the mix of console and GUI based feel to play the game.

## Instructions to Play
### JavaScript
Two different options to play - [Player vs Player](https://abhisheksarkar30.github.io/tic-tac-toe/player-player.html) and [Player vs Computer](https://abhisheksarkar30.github.io/tic-tac-toe/player-computer.html)

### Java
Download the code in your machine and hit the command to start playing: ***javac tictactoe.java && java tictactoe***.
Must have a basic java version preinstalled.
